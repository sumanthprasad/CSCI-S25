    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization\n",
    "## Due Date: Wednesday, June 11th by 11:59 PM MT on Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Submission Instructions Are Provided at the end of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform tasks to clean, visualize, and explore data\n",
    "2. Think critically about how plots provide insight into the data.\n",
    "3. Wrangle data for analysis\n",
    "4. Use EDA to learn about your data \n",
    "5. Choose appropriate types of visualization for given feature types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity.  However a key step in learning and retention is **creating solutions on your own.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone elseâ€™s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
    "your instructor or teaching assistant rather than another student as this situation can easily\n",
    "lead to a, possibly inadvertent, cheating situation.\n",

    "## Grading\n",
    "Grading is broken down into autograded answers and free response. \n",
    "\n",
    "For autograded answers, the results of your code are compared to provided and/or hidden tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For free response, readers will evaluate how well you answered the question and/or fulfilled the requirements of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots, your plots should be *similar* to the given examples. We will tolerate small variations such as color differences or slight variations in scale. However it is in your best interest to make the plots as similar as possible, as similarity is subject to the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that for ALL plotting questions from here on out, we will expect appropriate titles, axis labels, legends, etc. The following question serves as a good guideline on what is \"enough\": If I directly downloaded the plot and viewed it, would I be able to tell what was being visualized without knowing the question?** \n",

In matplotlib, plotting occurs on a set of Axes which are associated with a Figure. An analogy is that on a blank canvas (Figure), you choose a location to plot (`Axes`) and then fill it in (plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to labeling and manipulating figure contents, which we'll discuss below. Approach 1 is closest to the plotting paradigm of MATLAB, the namesake of matplotlib; Approach 2 is also common because many matplotlib-based packages (such as Seaborn) explicitly return the current set of axes after plotting data. Both are essentially equivalent, and at the end of this class you'll be comfortable with both. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 1**: matplotlib (or Seaborn) will auto-plot onto the current set of Axes or (if none exists) create a new figure/set of default axes. You can plot data using methods from `plt`, which is shorthand for the `matplotlib.pyplot` package. Then subsequent `plt` calls all edit the same set of default-created axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach 2**:  \n",
